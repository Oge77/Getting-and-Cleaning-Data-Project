Study design
Experimental design and background
In some smartphones these sensors are embedded by default and we benefit from this to classify a set of physical activities (standing, walking, laying, walking, walking upstairs and walking downstairs) by processing inertial body signals through a supervised Machine Learning (ML) algorithm for hardware with limited resources.
The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed the six activities previously mentioned wearing the smartphone on the waist.
The obtained database has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the patterns has been used for training purposes and 30% as test data
A Samsung Galaxy S2 smartphone has been exploited for the experiments, as it contains an accelerometer and a gyroscope for measuring 3-axial linear acceleration and angular velocity respectively at a constant rate of 50Hz, which is sufficient for capturing human body motion.
vector of 17 features is obtained by calculating variables from the accelerometer signals in the time and frequency domain (e.g. mean, standard deviation, signal magnitude area, entropy, signal-pair correlation, etc.). Fast Fourier Transform is used for finding the signal frequency components. Finally, these patterns are used as input of the trained SVM Classifier for the recognition of the activities.

Input: Raw data


For each record it is provided:
- Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the estimated body acceleration.
- Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope. 
- A 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables. 
- Its activity label. 
- An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.

The dataset includes the following files:
- 'README.txt'
- 'features_info.txt': Shows information about the variables used on the feature vector.
- 'features.txt': List of all features.
- 'activity_labels.txt': Links the class labels with their activity name.
- 'train/X_train.txt': Training set.
- 'train/y_train.txt': Training labels.
- 'test/X_test.txt': Test set.
- 'test/y_test.txt': Test labels.




The following files are available for the train and test data. Their descriptions are equivalent. 
- 'train/subject_train.txt': Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample. Its range is from 1 to 30. 
- 'train/Inertial Signals/total_acc_x_train.txt': The acceleration signal from the smartphone accelerometer X axis in standard gravity units 'g'. Every row shows a 128 element vector. The same description applies for the 'total_acc_x_train.txt' and 'total_acc_z_train.txt' files for the Y and Z axis. 
- 'train/Inertial Signals/body_acc_x_train.txt': The body acceleration signal obtained by subtracting the gravity from the total acceleration. 
- 'train/Inertial Signals/body_gyro_x_train.txt': The angular velocity vector measured by the gyroscope for each window sample. The units are radians/second.

- Features are normalized and bounded within [-1,1].
- Each feature vector is a row on the text file.

Output: Tidy data
For each record it is provided:
- An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.
- the activity names. 
A 561-feature vector with time and frequency for mean and standard deviation
The following files are available for tidy data
- run_analysis.R
- tidy_data.txt
- ReadMe.txt
- CodeBook



Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
